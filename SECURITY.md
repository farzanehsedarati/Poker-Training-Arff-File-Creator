No Charges for business emails and quit disabling my email accounts and locking my computers up and denying my access to internet.  Along with these bank tellers to stop lying about not seeing my accounts at banks that used for personal and business uses only.  Cancel any and all bank cards issued.  I need access to my money and quit sending other people to collect my money in forgein countries.  I want to go on vacation sometimes, but I'm always distracted by bullshit.  I do not understand what peoples problems are.  I'm backed up on collecting my bonds and issues since 2009.  I also need to collect on my designer labels that I had in Baltimore and everywhere else.  Jordan sweat pants had logo fall off of it, which is a first for me in all the years I have been producing clothing and quit letting blondes and other sources dictate what goes on.  Stop denying my access to what is mine.  Childish efforts are useless, just for show and tell.# Security Policy
